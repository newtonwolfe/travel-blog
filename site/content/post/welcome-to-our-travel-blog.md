At long last, we've finally gotten our travel blog off the ground. It only took the majority of the trip...**

Our current plan is to ~~simultaneously add posts from present day as well as slowly work through our backlog of posts from earlier in the trip?~~ *~~recreate past content in chronlogical order~~?* continue to figure it out as we go!

Whether you've been hanging on the edge of your seat for us to release this blog, or had no idea we were writing one, or have no idea who we are, we're excited to share with you the experiences we've had on our adventures. Stay tuned for an introductory / explanatory post, and for now, here's a nice photo from Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.

Thanks for tuning in, and until next post.

//// Newton + Willa

*=Have you ever used content editors such as Wordpress, Blogger, etc.? Have you noticed how they really like to title the first post, "Hello World"? Well, we're glad to report that Netlify, the service we're using, does NOT do that! However, Willa insisted on titling this post as such regardless.

**=Newton would like to mention that this is mostly because of bears. The bears that are Front End / Web Dev. Those bears are challenging to wrangle. Kudos to all of you front end/web devs.
