One of the only places we made a notable mistake (thanks in large part to Willa's planning) when it came to transportation planning was during our visit to the Kansai region. I figured I'd put this post together discussing why we made that mistake and our advice to other travelers.

Most tourists to Japan will hear or see something about the JR Rail Pass, which covers all of the Japan Railways Group lines except a few of the Shinkansen bullet trains. This pass is very useful, but also very expensive - $262 for 7 days (as of June 2018; USD). There are plenty of trips for which it makes sense, but also many that don't - it only really becomes cost-effective if the trip involves more than one Shinkansen leg.

A lesser-publicized option is the mini JR Passes offered by different JR companies. There are a lot of these mini passes, and they have myriad different areas, train restrictions, and usage schedules - but they can save you a lot of money if you use them right.

We got the JR West Kansai Area Pass - a pass that covers most JR West trains in the Kansai area. This made sense to us; we'd be traveling heavily around the Kansai area, given that we'd be using Kyoto as our home base for the 4 days we were there and our various destinations were spread out over the Kansai region.

We knew of the existence of the JR West Kansai Wide Area Pass, but didn't need the additional area, since we didn't have any plans to visit destinations that were in the expanded area.

One of the assumptions we made was that JR would have a reasonably dense network; this is true in Tokyo where a significant amount of inner-city trains are JR trains, and we both enjoy walking around cities. This assumption wasn't really true; while JR has a ring network in Osaka, most of the rest of the JR network is just intercity, meaning it was great for core travel but poor for actually getting to our destinations.

The other thing we failed to note was that the Kansai Area Pass doesn't cover the Shinkansen or limited express trains, which are the fastest intercity lines. It turns out this wasn't an issue for our itinerary (the time savings are relatively low on short hops), but it would have been if we had been travelling longer distances frequently.



The better solution (that we were not aware of until we landed in Osaka) was the Kansai Thru Pass, offered by a collection of other rail companies in the Kansai area. It covers a lot of transit options in the Kansai area, and has a much denser network than JR. For example, both the Osaka and Kyoto subway systems are covered. While the intercity trains are a little less organized than JR's, given that they aren't part of a single company, they're still effective for getting around. Most of the time when getting directions from Google Maps, the most optimal routing between destinations was on covered systems, while the most optimal routing between big stations was on JR.

The dense network may sound trivial, but the last-mile connections are a significant portion of the cost on normal rail journeys.
